# Mechanics of the Rotary Head
This repository is a part of a larger project. The description of it can be found in the [rotary-head-software](https://github.com/JanOlencki/rotary-head-software) repository.

## Features
* Two heads (azimuth and polarization)
* Stepper motor mounting
* Smooth rotation due to ball bearings
* 1:3.6 gear ratio (0.5Â° resolution when fully stepping a 200-step motor)
* Geodesy tribrach mounting
* Precise tribrach-based leveling
* RF connection via *Fairview Microwave SR1803* rotary joint
* Easily removable enclosure
* Enclosure compatible with the [Rotary Head Controller PCBs](https://github.com/JanOlencki/rotary-head-electronics)
* Laser holders used to position towers relative to each other

## Manufacturing
The original milled parts are made from nylon and steel without the use of numerically controlled machines. There are no tolerances marked or introduced in the models of these parts.

The enclosures and holders are printed from PETG. The models of the 3D printed parts include small gaps, that allows you to simply print and fit these parts with virtually no modification.

## Repository contents
* Separate Bills of Materials for each Rotary Head
* Models of the milled parts in the STEP format
* Models of the 3D printed parts in the STEP format
* Photos and renders
